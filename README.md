## Implemented a Twitter Sentiment Analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets.
* Performed exploratory data analysis and Data Visualization of target variable.
    - Plotted distribution of data and countplot of Positive and Negative examples in the dataset using seaborn and matplotlib
* Performed various pre-processing steps on the dataset that mainly dealt with 
    - removing stopwords and emojis.  
    - converted the text document into lowercase for better generalization.
    - removed punctuation marks to eliminate noise from the dataset.
    - removed the repeating characters from the words along with removing the URLs as they are not important.
    - performed stemming and lemmatization for better results.
* Transformed dataset using TFIDF Vectorizer and trained different Machine Learning models to determine the best accuracy and improved the results.
